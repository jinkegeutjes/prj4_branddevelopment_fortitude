          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our brand is called Fortitude, and it focuses on mindset exercises, training and stress relieving. It is an app that helps young athletes relieve stress and set their mindset right before the game or practice. Our campaign focuses on young athletes, specifically football players, who fight with stress and a bad mindset before a football practice or game. Our campaign wants to show them how to relieve the stress, anxiety and decomposure, and set their mind to peace and calmness before going into the field by preparing their minds and bodies, as well as showing them how stress can affect games in the first place and make the game player anxious and nervous. We wanna assure that every player feels confident and self-assured, that he is gonna give the best he can into the game, because as we say in Fortitude, “With a strong mind comes a stronger game’’.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This is what we try to achieve and show on our social media. We decided to show our audience that it all comes with the right mindset, which we can help prepare with Fortitude. We chose 2 platforms to promote our brand, Instagram and TikTok. On Instagram, we posted different stories, and posts, such as carousels, reels, and photos. If we did reels we also used TikTok and posted a reel in there, as well as a couple of pictures of inspirational quotes, while choosing nice music. We chose these platforms because our target audience is Gen Z adults, aged 18-24, and according to E-marketer TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram, each draws roughly 80% of Gen Z social network users and are the most popular platform among Gen Z Adults (Emarketer, 2023). This is why we decided that it would be easiest to reach our target audience through these platforms. We used funny and popular trends, popular music and inspirational quotes to engage with the audience, as well as having a poll in stories to receive some answers from the audience and engage with them.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Communication objectives:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><em>Reach objective:</em> we want 1000 people to see our message in our time frame of March 8th - April 4th (4 weeks and the day before the deadline) on TikTok and Instagram&nbsp;</p>
          <p><em>Affect:</em> We want our target audience to feel a sense of self-assurance and of being at peace/calm. We want them to feel inspired to improve their mental strength.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Response:</em> We want the target audience to become aware of our brand and to go to our website after viewing our posts. Engagement rate and followers.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Firstly, our reach objective is to reach 1000 people. On Instagram, our biggest reel was seen by 475 people, which didn’t reach our target audience objective, but on TikTok, our biggest reel was seen 4,836 times, which reached the objective by almost 5 times. We think this might have happened during a lack of subscribers since Instagram is easier to reach with people who subscribed to the account, or are watching videos related to our topic, while TikTok is available to everyone, and if you choose a particular music, which in this case was a trendy song and TikTok trend, “And when I’m back in Chicago, I feel it’’, a user clicking on this song can see all the TikToks created with this song, which could have made our TikTok reach more bigger audience.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The <strong>second objective</strong> we set was making our audience feel self-assured and calm, at peace with their mindset and wanting to change their mental strength and mindset. We reached this by choosing our colour palette and using the right tone of voice, and posts that relate to our campaign.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our colour palette includes calm colours such as light purple, blue, green, white and light Turkish blue. Our colour palette connects to the football field (green and white), as well as using the colours that are set because according to India Times magazine, these are the most relaxing colours for stress-free life (India Times, 2017). This is why we decided to set our tone in these colours, that represent our mindset app. To help our audience with setting their minds and reach for peace and calm, we posted different posts that represented it, such as inspirational quotes, carousels, reels, and stories. After each post, we added a small description of how to reach it. We posted a couple of posts describing important facts about mental health, statistics, as well as a small description of how to reach that mind peace. On TikTok our descriptions were smaller since TikTok audiences tend not to notice a description as much as on Instagram, so we tried to keep it short. In the end, we believe that our goal was reached since our account really represents our brand and really focuses on those stress-free colours. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;The <strong>third objective</strong> that we set was a response objective. We believe that we reached this objective, since from the beginning till the end, we saw how our audience was growing and how our numbers of likes and views had been increasing. We started with 0 followers, and at the end of the deadline, we had 35 followers on our Instagram. This is not a lot, but as mentioned before, it reaches a little bigger audience if the person is following this type of content, which in our case is football. According to the Instagram professional dashboard (Appendix C) that we use to follow our progress, we reached 32 followers and 260 non followers, which shows that our brand was not only reached by people that subscribed to us, but also by people that watched similar content. The most popular posts were reels, especially the ones following famous trends. The same happened with TikTok. Even though on TikTok we managed to get only a couple followers, our biggest post was seen 4,836 times, which shows that it was reached by a lot of people with similar interests. The other posts received around 1000 views.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we made our audience get to know our brand a little better, always mentioning in the posts description what we are promoting. We mentioned the Fortitude app, that all the mindset exercises could be found there, as well as promoting our website. Our last posts focused on the website by posting a reminder that the website is gonna be launching soon. We believe that our target audience would be willing to go to our website or even our app by seeing our social media profiles, especially football players, because our social media really focused on promoting it as well as making it more engaging with the audience. </p>
<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>The main thing that we learned from our assignment is that we were over-ambitious regarding how frequently we would post. Based on our communication plan and content calendar, we were aiming to post every other day for the duration of four weeks. We quickly learned that for our team it was difficult for us to create content that quickly and for such a long period of time, resulting in us posting around every three to four days on Instagram and TikTok.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Another thing that we learnt during the campaign, was that it was more difficult to reach our target group through Instagram than through TikTok. We did manage to reach our goal for TikTok, but not for Instagram. One example of this is how our “that one old guy who always comes to hype the team up at every game” video had 264 views on Instagram and 1326 views on TikTok. This point is further emphasized by the final reach of accounts on the different platforms, which shows how much higher of a reach TikTok had, as can be seen in Appendix C.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When it came to what worked and what did not, we noticed that the videos would work better for increasing our reach (most likely as they were more relatable and funny videos that also used current trends), while the informative posts or posts about our brand worked less well. For example, our “what can Fortitude do for you” post only reached 36 accounts while one of our videos with trending music and a training montage reached 329 accounts.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Regarding the project, we learned that one weak point was staying consistent with posting. So to improve on this, we would make sure to change the way we created the content. Instead of making the posts on the day of or the day before, we would create a batch of posts at the beginning of each week to post and use the post scheduling tool in Instagram and TikTok, to be more consistent. Furthermore, we would adapt our content more to what was reaching accounts better, such as relatable videos while merging them with more information about our brand. </p>
<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p><em>Reflection on what has been done</em>: For the past month, we, the team of Fortitude, have been regularly posting on both the social media platforms TikTok and Instagram. We have created these posts to follow our colour palette as well as the interests of our target audience.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><em>Recommendations for the future:</em> In the future, it would be best for the marketing team to sit together once or twice a week to talk about the posting schedule and create the posts together. In the past, the marketing team was not in harmony with each other, which resulted in posts having different styles and a different tone of voice. In between these meetings with the marketing team, every person within the team should gather ideas and inspiration so they come prepared for each session. </p>
<p>&nbsp;For future planning, we created a social media plan for what the next 3 weeks would look like:
